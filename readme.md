## What is Titon? ##

Titon is a modular web framework built on Hack that runs in HHVM. It is written with simplicity and efficiency in mind, with enough room for extensibility and abstraction. The framework takes advantage of Hack's strict mode, type system, generics, collections, and more. It also integrates the wonderful PSRs from PHP-FIG for increased interoperability with external PHP code bases and libraries.

## Testing ##

Titon comes packaged with a Vagrant box and a handful of Python scripts to ease the testing process. Boot up the Vagrant instance with `vagrant up` and SSH into the box with `vagrant ssh`. Once in Vagrant, you can run the following command to run tests.

```bash
/vagrant/bin/run-tests
```

Or run tests for a single file or folder.

```bash
/vagrant/bin/run-tests --path=Titon/Common
```

Or filter tests based on class or method name.

```bash
/vagrant/bin/run-tests --filter=methodName
```

#### Hack Strict Mode ####

For the most part, Titon strives to be strict mode only. This can be very challenging, but with Hack's built-in type checker, it couldn't be easier. Simply run the following command to check for strict issues.

```bash
/vagrant/bin/type-check
```

Or type check a specific folder.

```bash
/vagrant/bin/type-check --path=Titon/Utility
```

When filtering down by path, multiple errors will still arise like "Was expecting a class", "Unbound name", "Unbound global constant", "This is not a container, this is an object of type X", etc. The main cause of this issue is that the type checker is ran in a sub-folder, and not the root, so all those classes are not in scope. This should not be an issue if the type checker is ran in the source root.
